 # Road Requests Exercise
 

> My collections for this assignment  was "Cities-and-Towns" collections i thought it was very interesting, the link to it in webpage format is:
https://www.loc.gov/collections/cities-and-towns (Highly recommend).


## Findings on JSON view
* This format is a self-describing and for some very easy to understand it also has various software tools to help navigate throught this program.
* JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties, A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value, so far its pretty easy to get the hang of.

  
## WebPage Understanding

* A list of items on the collection "Cities-and-Towns is diplayed with an image and text with a title and a short description on the right hand side of the page so the person viewing can qickly see what they are viewing which is user friendly.
* On your screen the viewer its a list of data types you can use to search up such as: online format and original format, etc you name it they will find it. In the JSON format you the viewer can access multiple pages with up to 25 links .
* In my opinion this web page view is much easier to understand and navigate.

## Command-line View
* The command line is a user interface navigated using commands at prompts, instead of using a mouse for the average user its harder to understand and may cause alot of confusion for the end user.
* In my opinion the command line view is harder as was stated but for person with the knowledge it would be way easier, its all about a learning process when it comes to this and no one will be boss at this within a day so its a learning curve.
