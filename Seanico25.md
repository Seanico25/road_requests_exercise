 # Road Requests Exercise

## The US Library of Congress 
* The collections: https://www.loc.gov/collections/
 

> My collection for this assignment was "Cities-and-Towns". I thought it was very interesting, the link to it in webpage format is:
https://www.loc.gov/collections/cities-and-towns (Highly recommend).


## Findings on JSON view
* This format is self-describing and for some, very easy to understand. It consists of various software tools to help the user to navigate throught the program.
* JSON data is written as name/value pairs, similar to JavaScript object properties, that is, a name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value.
* My thoughts on it so far, is that provied it is laid out in language that is understandable, it will be easier to navigate and apply going forward.  

  
## WebPage Understanding

* A list of items on the collection "Cities-and-Towns" is diplayed with an image, text, title and a short description on the right hand side of the page. This allows the person viewing to quickly see a snap shot of what they are viewing. It is also user friendly, which is a positive.
* On the screen, the viewer sees a list of data types that can be used to search topics such as: online format and original format, etc. It's quite useful, just name it and the system will find it. In the JSON format, the viewer can also access multiple pages with up to 25 links. This is helpful when searching more than one topic without losng the web page for a different one.
* In my opinion this web page view is much easier to understand and navigate.

## Command-line View
* The command line is a user interface navigated using commands at prompts, instead of using a mouse. For the average user its harder to understand and may cause alot of confusion if the user is not familiar with this format.
* In my opinion the command line view is harder as was stated before, however, for persons with the knowledge in this area, it may be way easier. This is definitey a learning process. The learning curve may be a bit steep for some of us, we may not become specialists at this within a day.
