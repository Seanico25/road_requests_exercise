https://www.loc.gov/collections/cities-and-towns (Highly recommend).


## Findings on JSON view
* This format is a self-describing and for some very easy to understand it also has various software tools to help navigate throught this program.
* JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties, A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value, so far its pretty easy to get the hang off.

  
## WebPage Understanding

* A list of items on the collection "Cities-and-Towns is diplayed with an image and text with a title and a short description on the right hand side of the page so the person viewing can qickly see what they are viewing.
* On your screen the viewer its a list of data types you can use to search up such as: online format and original format, etc you name it they will find it. Unlike the JSON format you the viewer can access multiple pages with up to 25 items per page or more .

## Command-line View
